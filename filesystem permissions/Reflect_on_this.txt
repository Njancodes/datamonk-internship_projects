1. The execute permission is useful if you want to showcase the files in a directory but not necessarily show its metadata. If the execute permission is disabled for this directory, while the other permissions are enabled. The user can't open the directory and even get the metadata of the files. Tldr: While the files can be listed, the metadata will not be exposed.

2. Suppose a attacker gains access to your web server as some user. Giving permisssions to writ, read and even execute a file can prove dangerous because he can change the contents of the file to implant a virus or even a remote shell execution script. In the case of directory, he can write any file to his hearts content in that directory and even execute a whole range of files.

3. Using the symbolic mode is a safer and better choice, because in the octal mode the permissions are overwritten, therefore we would have to read the previous permissions and appropriately apply it while changing it's permissions. On the other hand, symbolic mode is appends permissions to the file, thus there won't be any possibility of an incorrect change of permissions.

4. sudo rm -rf / temp_files/ is dangerous command, because rm removes and files or directories. Here , the flags -rf (r for recursively, f for force) recursively deletes all the files in the sub-directories and don't even ask you whether the files are important or not. At last, '/' specifies the root of the operating system, which means the top level folder , if deleted, would be catastrophic for your os. The sudo command is the one that makes this dangerous as you just gave root priveligies to yourself and the system won't question you about it. Thus, your whole os is broken.

5. Giving 'others' read and write permissions gives permission to everyone not just the developers group. The chown is a more secure and scalable way to manage thteam access, as it gives the developers group the permisssion to open that directory called project/.
