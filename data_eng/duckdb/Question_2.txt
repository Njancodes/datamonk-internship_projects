Benefits and limitations of working with CSVs in DuckDB

Super lightweight
Zero-ETL analysis (No need to load into a table first)
Great for prototyping
because CSVs are columns, duckdb is efficeient in columnar execution

Limitations

No schema enforcement: No foreign keys and such
Numeric columns might get be read as strings and not numeric
not transactional cause you cant insert or update the rows
