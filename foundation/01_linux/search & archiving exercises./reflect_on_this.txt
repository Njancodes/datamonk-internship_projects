1. I think the reason linux have different options for help is because each option caters to specific people. man shows detailed manual pages that is great for documentation. --help provides a quick information of the commands. help is well for bash built-in commands
help is probably the correct choice if we are looking for instructions for bash built-in commands like cd, or echo.

2. ls | grep ".txt" looks only at files in the current directory, that is not recursively. find . -name "*.txt" searches recursively through the directory tree and uses actual file metadata.
I believe find is more powerful because of searching recursively, looking through the metadata etc whereas ls | grep needed two commands to function, that too, for simple, flat-directory filtering.

3. If you remember the command you ran last week (for example: ssh) you can pipe the contents of history to grep with the pattern "ssh"
history | grep "ssh" 

4. Well, tar.gz holds the permissions and symlinks, therefore crucial for linux systems.
Also, natively supported by most linux tools (tar, gzip), and this usually results in smaller files.
There are plenty of security risks in extracting a archive or zip folder from an unknown source. One of them is a zip bomb, which is a zip file upon extraction causes large amount of data to flood the system which can disrupt the system. Another one is scripts or binaries that might run after extracting.
